# 🧵 Singly Linked List in C++

This project implements a basic singly linked list in C++ with essential operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and display. It's designed for educational purposes and demonstrates core concepts of dynamic memory management and modular programming.

## 📌 Features

- Insert at the beginning
- Insert at the end
- Delete a node by value
- Search for a value
- Display the list
- Proper memory cleanup via destructor

## 🛠️ Code Structure

- `ListNode`: Struct representing a node in the list.
- `LinkedList`: Class encapsulating all linked list operations.

## 📂 File Contents

- `linked_list.cpp`: Contains the full implementation of the linked list.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Compilation

To compile and run the code:
